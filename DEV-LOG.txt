Finished initial design and after a lot of trouble calibrating the the 3d printer for ABS got
a first print:
- ABS shrinks, I didn't account for that
- PCB doesn't have enough space to slot into the angles under the nut holders
- the probe socket pins are incorrectly spaced ( too narrow )
- the USB connector is too far from front case
- the holes in the panel didn't line up of the right hand side (mismeasurement)
- holes too small for screws (shrinkage?)
- the lid fits too loose (shrinkage + 2*fit_tolerance)
- the hole for the SSR plug is a tight fit but works.
- support material got inside the but holders mkaing them useless.

Mods
- removed nut holders they were unnecessary
- a melted a slot in the front panel to allow the PCB to get slightly closer
  and thus slot into the case properly.
- drilled out holes for lid screws 
- drilled out hole for PCB attachment 
- melted the pins on the thermister plug to "fit"
- drilled hole through front panel screw hole

After that everything seems to fit nicely.
Since this is a once off prototype I haven't fixed the model.
